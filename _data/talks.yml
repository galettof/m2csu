  title: Free Resolutions, Finite and Infinite
  abstract: "<p> Abelian groups -- modules
  over the integers -- are well-described by giving generators and
  relations, conveniently described by one matrix of integers. For
  modules over a polynomial ring in n variables David Hilbert improved
  the description to one requiring n matrices, the &quot;free
  resolution&quot;. But for most commutative rings, the corresponding
  description requires infinitely many matrices.  </p> In the finite
  case, we know a lot, and in the first half of this talk I will
  survey some of what we've learned in the 130 years since Hilbert's
  work. But except for very special cases, we know almost nothing in
  the infinite case. In the second half of the talk I will introduce
  some new problems and conjectures that Hai Long Dao and I have been
  working on, with the help of the program Macaulay2."

  title: Subcomplexes of Certain Free Resolutions
  abstract: "What are the subcomplexes of a free
  resolution? This question is simple to state, but the naive approach
  leads to a computational quagmire that is infeasible even in small
  cases. In this talk, I invoke the Bernstein--Gelfand--Gelfand (BGG)
  correspondence to address this question for free resolutions given
  by two well-known complexes, the Koszul and the
  Eagon--Northcott. This novel approach provides a complete
  characterization of the ranks of free modules in a subcomplex in the
  Koszul case and imposes numerical restrictions in the
  Eagon--Northcott case."

  title: Algebraic Study of Weighted Oriented Graphs
  abstract: "In this talk, we will consider the edge ideals of weighted oriented graphs. In the first half of the talk, we will survey some of the results about the algebraic invariants of these monomial ideals. The second half of the talk will focus on Morse resolutions of monomial ideals and we will discuss when these resolutions are minimal. As an application, we will present minimal cellular free resolutions of edge ideals of certain classes of weighted oriented graphs."

  title: Certifying roots of polynomial systems on Macaulay2
  abstract: "We present the Macaulay2 package NumericalCertification for certifying the correctness of approximations for roots of square polynomial systems. It employs the Krawczyk method and Î±-theory as the main methods for certification. The package works with output data computed in Macaulay2 without using external software. Also, we introduce potential extensions of the package to the multiple roots certification."

  title: Computing the minimum distance of a linear code
  abstract: "Computing the minimum distance of a linear code is an NP-hard problem
that is relevant to certain mathematical research and engineering
applications. In this talk, I will explain reasons why computing the
minimum weight of a linear code is an important feature in a software
package for coding theory research. I will also give an overview of the
state of our minimum weight algorithm implementation in the package
CodingTheory, including how it compares with other available
implementations as well as possibilities for improvement."

  title: Experiments with toric vector bundles
  abstract: "We will examine a few open problems and speculate about why this might be a fruitful area for computational experimentation.  We will also showcase some new calculations in the developing ToricReflexiveSheaves package."

- first: Anton
  last: Leykin
  title: Solving polynomial systems equation-by-equation
  abstract: "The task of describing the complex variety cut out by a sequence of polynomial equations is one of the central tasks of numerical algebraic geometry.
We develop a new geometric construction that addresses this &quot;equation by equation&quot;. The resulting algorithm called &quot;u-generation&quot; uses a smaller number of continuation paths in comparison to the state-of-the-art analogs. Apart from theoretical advances, I will demonstrate Macaulay2 tools necessary for an implementation of u-generation. (This is joint work with Tim Duff and Jose Rodriguez.)"
