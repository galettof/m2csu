		  <p>We are organizing a Macaulay2 conference at Cleveland State University in Cleveland, OH from Friday, May 27 to Sunday, May 29 (conference activities running from Friday afternoon through Sunday morning).</p>

		  <p>The main goal of the conference is to showcase state-of-the-art research in computational commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and related areas, including (but not limited to) work resulting from the <a href="workshop.html">2020 M2@CSU workshop</a>. In addition, we hope the conference will provide an ideal forum for the exchange of mathematical ideas in our community; in order to facilitate social interactions among colleagues, we will focus primarily on in-person participation.</p>

		  <!--
		  <p>More details about location, speakers and schedule will be provided in the new year.</p>
		  -->

		  <p>For planning purposes, we kindly request all interested participants to <a href="register.html">register here</a>. NSF funding will provide partial support for travel and lodging (priority will go to graduate students, postdocs, and participants from underrepresented communities). If you wish to apply for this kind of support, we ask that you submit your application by January 31, 2022.</p>
